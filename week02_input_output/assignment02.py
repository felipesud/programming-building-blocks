print(f"Today, my fabulous camp group went to a (an) {adjective.upper()} amusement park. It was a fun park with lots of cool  {plural_noun.upper()} and enjoyable play structures. When we got there, my kind counselor shouted loudly, \"Everybody off the {noun.upper()}.\" We all pushed out in a terrible hurry. My counselor handed out {color.upper()} tickets, and we scurried in. I was so excited! I couldn't figure out what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary roller coaster I really liked so, I  {first_adverb.upper()} ran over to get in the long line that had about {number.upper()} people in it. When I finally got on the roller coaster I was  {past_verb.upper()}. In fact I was so nervous my two knees were knocking together. This was the  {est_adjective.upper()} ride I had ever been on!
